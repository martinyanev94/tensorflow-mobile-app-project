# Final Project: Mobile AI Application Development

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course to develop a mobile application using TensorFlow. The project encourages individual creativity and innovation while reinforcing the practical application of machine learning concepts.

## Project Overview
Students will create a mobile application (iOS and/or Android) that leverages TensorFlow to perform a specific task, such as image classification, stock price prediction, or game playing with reinforcement learning. The application should demonstrate an understanding of model building, training, and deployment on mobile devices.

## Project Components

### 1. Choose Your Application Type
Select one of the following types of applications to develop:

#### a. Image Classification App
- Use a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify images taken from the camera or uploaded from the gallery.
- Example models: MobileNet, InceptionV3.
  
#### b. Stock Price Prediction App
- Build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with historical stock data.
- Predict future stock prices based on past trends.

#### c. Game Playing App
- Implement a game (e.g., Connect 4) that uses an AlphaZero-like reinforcement learning model to play against the user or itself.
- Focus on building an intuitive game interface with the AI making intelligent moves.

### 2. Set Up the Development Environment
- Install TensorFlow and other necessary dependencies.
- Set up either Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android) for mobile application development.

### 3. Model Building and Training
- For the chosen application, gather the relevant dataset (if applicable) and perform necessary preprocessing.
- Build and train your model using TensorFlow.
  - **Image Classification**: Use transfer learning with pre-trained models.
  - **Stock Price Prediction**: Create and train an RNN or LSTM model.
  - **Game Playing**: Develop and train an AI model with reinforcement learning.

### 4. Mobile Application Development
- Implement user interfaces that allow users to interact with your application.
- Integrate the TensorFlow model into your app:
  - For iOS apps, create a bridge between Objective-C/Swift and TensorFlow C++ APIs.
  - For Android apps, use the TensorFlow Android library.

### 5. Testing and Optimization
- Rigorously test the application for bugs and ensure the functionality of the model.
- Optimize the model for mobile deployment, considering factors like speed and accuracy.

### 6. Documentation
- Prepare a report detailing:
  - The chosen application type and its significance.
  - The model development process, including challenges faced and how they were overcome.
  - Instruction guide on how to install and run the application.

### 7. Presentation
- Present your completed application to the class, highlighting the key features, user experience, and any future enhancements you might consider.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Project Concept**: Clarity and creativity of the chosen application (20%)
- **Technical Implementation**: Successful integration of TensorFlow with mobile application (30%)
- **User Experience**: Design and functionality of the user interface (20%)
- **Documentation**: Quality and thoroughness of the project report (20%)
- **Presentation**: Effectiveness of the project presentation (10%)

## Conclusion
This project will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of key machine learning concepts and their application in mobile environments. Take advantage of this opportunity to create something unique and insightful!
